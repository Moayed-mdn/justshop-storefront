# Monitoring And Logging

## Purpose

This document describes the current monitoring and logging reality for the JustShop frontend.

Code surfaces this file aligns with:

- `server/middleware/log.ts`
- `nuxt.config.ts`
- `app/**`
- `server/**`
- `src/core/runtime/observability/logRuntimeEvent.ts`
- `server/middleware/01.tenant.ts`

## Current Logging Reality

Visible logging today is limited and mostly console-based.

Current examples include:

- `server/middleware/log.ts` logging request URLs
- `src/core/runtime/observability/logRuntimeEvent.ts` emitting structured runtime event records with tenant, locale, path, request id, artifact, and status fields
- `server/middleware/01.tenant.ts` resolving the tenant, computing the rollout flag, and rejecting non-legacy storefront paths when the runtime is disabled for that tenant
- `console.error(...)` calls in search, product detail, verification, Google auth, and share flows
- `console.warn(...)` in guest-cart merge behavior

## Current Observability Signals

- browser console output
- server console output
- request URL logging from server middleware
- structured runtime event records for storefront runtime flows
- user-reported broken flows

## Current Gaps

- No dashboard configuration is visible in the repo.
- No alerting rules are visible in the repo.
- No structured log pipeline is encoded in repository config.
- No tracing or metrics instrumentation is visible.

## Operational Use Today

When diagnosing runtime issues today:

1. reproduce the affected browser flow
2. inspect browser console output
3. inspect server logs for request flow and runtime errors
4. confirm env and backend endpoint availability
5. isolate whether the problem is in UI state, Nitro proxying, backend responses, or GraphQL search

## `nuxt-ssr-api-logger` Note

The active module list includes `nuxt-ssr-api-logger`, so SSR API logging integration exists at module level. This repository does not currently provide deeper operational configuration for it in docs or dedicated config files, so treat it as present but lightly documented.

## Runtime Contract Reference

The storefront runtime migration now defines the required future logging contract in:

- `docs/operations/storefront-runtime-logging-specification-v1.md`

That specification is the Phase 1 contract target for the Laravel runtime APIs. This owner document still describes the current live repo observability reality and should not be read as claiming the future logging schema is already implemented.

## Phase 7 Monitoring Evidence

Controlled rollout evidence for the storefront runtime is tracked separately in:

- `docs/refactoring-plan/storefront-runtime-phase-7-monitoring-log.md`
- `docs/refactoring-plan/storefront-runtime-phase-7-evidence.md`

Those files capture the Phase 7 operator record for:

- runtime error rate
- `runtime.rollout_disabled` response count
- catch-all `404` rate for CMS storefront paths
- SSR and runtime API latency
- legacy route availability
- SEO spot checks on sampled pages

They do not replace platform dashboards or alerting. They are the repo-backed evidence templates for operators to fill during staging and production rollout.

## Evidence To Capture During Incidents

- affected route and locale
- user auth state or guest state
- browser console errors
- relevant server log lines
- backend or GraphQL reachability symptoms

## Change Rules

- Update this document if structured logging, alerting, dashboards, or tracing are added.
- Keep this document honest about current gaps instead of implying a monitoring stack that is not visible in code.
