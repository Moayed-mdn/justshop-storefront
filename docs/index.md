# Documentation Index

## Purpose

This is the documentation hub for `/home/leader/projects/laravel/tenant/justshop-frontend`.

It links the current owner documents, records what has already been created, and shows what is still planned under the approved implementation roadmap in `docs/implementation-plan.md`.

## Current Source Anchors

These code surfaces currently anchor the foundation docs:

- `nuxt.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- `shared/utils/routes.ts`
- `app/stores/auth.ts`
- `app/stores/cart.ts`
- `app/composables/useApi.ts`
- `server/utils/api.ts`
- `app/plugins/01.auth.client.ts`
- `app/plugins/02.cart.client.ts`
- `app/plugins/api.ts`
- `app/plugins/apollo.client.ts`

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: foundation docs | Complete | Root governance, setup, env, and index docs exist |
| Phase 2: onboarding and templates | Complete | Templates, getting-started docs, and glossary now exist |
| Phase 3: architecture and configuration | Complete | Configuration, architecture, and missing reference owner docs now exist |
| Phase 4: development and operations | Complete | Development docs, `docs/reference/faq.md`, operations docs, and `CHANGELOG.md` now exist |
| Phase 5: audit closure and governance maintenance | Complete | Confirmed-removable files were deleted with backup artifacts and build verification, and the review-required type candidates now have executed keep/remove decisions |

## Planned Documentation Tree

The approved target tree is owned by `docs/implementation-plan.md`. The implementation plan phases are complete through Phase 5, and follow-up work now focuses on ADR formalization plus ongoing maintenance updates when code changes.

The storefront runtime transformation program is tracked separately under `docs/refactoring-plan/`, which now includes a dedicated README, an audit subfolder, and an archive for superseded draft plans.

## Ownership Rules

- Root docs stay concise and point to deeper owner documents.
- Setup and onboarding facts belong in `docs/getting-started/`.
- Runtime flow and system behavior belong in `docs/architecture/`.
- Configuration and env ownership belong in `docs/configuration/`.
- Engineering rules belong in `docs/development/`.
- Release and runtime procedures belong in `docs/operations/`.
- Shared definitions and templates belong in `docs/reference/` and `docs/templates/`.

## Accuracy Rules

- Every new document must be backed by current code or explicit approved decisions.
- If live code and older plan assumptions disagree, update the docs to match live code and record the discrepancy.
- Prefer linking to the owner document instead of duplicating technical detail across files.
