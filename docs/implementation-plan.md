# JustShop Frontend Documentation Implementation Plan

## 1. Purpose And Scope

This document defines the standardized end-to-end roadmap for building the complete documentation system for the `justshop-frontend` Nuxt 4 application. It converts the validated target documentation architecture into an implementation sequence that is dependency-safe, measurable, auditable, and aligned with the existing codebase.

This plan is based on the current repository state:

- Framework: Nuxt `4.2.1`, Vue `3.5.x`, Nitro server routes
- State management: Pinia with `pinia-plugin-persistedstate`
- Localization: `@nuxtjs/i18n` with English and Arabic locale bundles
- Data access: Nuxt server API handlers, `$fetch`, Apollo GraphQL client for search
- Current runtime config usage: `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- Existing project surfaces to document: `app/`, `server/`, `shared/utils/routes.ts`, `types/`, `i18n/`, `nuxt.config.ts`, `package.json`

Implementation objective:

- Create a durable documentation system that explains how the project is structured, configured, extended, verified, and deployed.
- Enforce synchronization rules so any future code, configuration, or deployment change updates documentation in the same change set.
- Remove non-product and redundant files only through a controlled audit workflow that protects required Nuxt assets and convention-based auto-loaded modules.

Success definition:

- All validated documentation files exist with project-specific content.
- Every core application surface has exactly one primary documentation owner file.
- No new undocumented environment variable, store, plugin, route family, or deployment behavior can enter the repository.
- High-confidence unused files are removed safely after backup and dependency validation.

## 2. Target Documentation Tree

The following structure must be created exactly as approved.

## 3. Current Codebase Alignment Baseline

The documentation system must reflect the real codebase that already exists.

### 3.1 Existing Code Assets That New Documentation Must Align With

| Existing asset | Documentation impact |
|---|---|
| `nuxt.config.ts` | Drives `README.md`, `docs/configuration/nuxt-config.md`, `runtime-config.md`, `modules.md`, `environment-variables.md`, `operations/environments.md`. |
| `package.json` | Drives script sections in `README.md`, `getting-started/running-locally.md`, and `operations/build-and-release.md`. |
| `app/stores/auth.ts` and `app/stores/cart.ts` | Drive `architecture/state-management.md` and `architecture/auth-and-security.md`. |
| `app/composables/useApi.ts` | Primary reference for `architecture/data-fetching.md` and `development/composables.md`. |
| `app/plugins/apollo.client.ts` and `app/graphql/queries/search.ts` | Drive GraphQL documentation in `architecture/data-fetching.md`, `configuration/plugins.md`, and `reference/external-services.md`. |
| `server/api/**` | Primary source for `development/server-routes.md`, `architecture/api-integration.md`, and deployment verification cases. |
| `server/utils/api.ts` | Documents server-side proxy behavior and runtime config usage. |
| `shared/utils/routes.ts` | Documents route contracts for frontend, internal API, and external backend mapping. |
| `app/middleware/*.ts` | Drives auth/routing sections in `architecture/auth-and-security.md` and `development/pages-layouts-middleware.md`. |
| `app/plugins/01.auth.client.ts`, `02.cart.client.ts`, `theme.client.ts`, `api.ts` | Drive plugin order and boot sequence guidance. |
| `i18n/locales/**` | Drive localization workflow in `project-structure.md`, `coding-standards.md`, and `seo.md`. |
| `app/assets/css/**` and `app/components/**` | Drive styling and component structure documentation. |
| `types/**` | Drive type ownership rules and duplication avoidance guidance. |

### 3.2 Mandatory Interface Rules For All New Documentation Files

- No new markdown file may describe behavior that is not visible in current code, approved backlog decisions, or deployment requirements.
- Each markdown file must name the code owners or code surfaces it documents.
- Each markdown file must link to the relevant implementation files when possible.
- No documentation file may redefine technical behavior already owned by another file; it must link to the owner file instead.
- Cross-references must be one-way by ownership:
  - setup facts live in `getting-started/*`
  - framework and flow decisions live in `architecture/*`
  - settings and env facts live in `configuration/*`
  - engineering rules live in `development/*`
  - release and runtime procedures live in `operations/*`
  - reusable definitions and templates live in `reference/*` and `templates/*`

## 4. File-By-File Alignment Specifications

Every new file must explicitly align to existing code assets and avoid overlapping ownership.

| New file | Must reference or align with | Interface and extension rule | Conflict avoidance protocol |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | `package.json`, `nuxt.config.ts`, `app/`, `server/` | Summarize only; deep detail must link into `docs/`. | Do not duplicate full env, deployment, or architecture details. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Repository workflow, `package.json`, future CI rules | Define PR, review, doc-update, and dependency approval process. | Keep behavioral system documentation out of this file. |
| `AGENTS.md` | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `nuxt.config.ts`, `server/api/**` | Encode mandatory AI and automation rules. | Must mirror contributor rules, not invent separate standards. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release output, deploy history | Track externally visible changes only. | Do not use as an implementation note archive. |
| `.env.example` | `nuxt.config.ts`, `server/utils/api.ts`, `app/plugins/apollo.client.ts` | Include placeholders for every active env variable. | Never include secrets or inferred unused vars. |

### 5.3 Phase Exit Criteria

| Phase | Exit criteria |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Root docs exist, environment variables are enumerated, and contribution rules are enforceable. |
| Phase 2 | Installation has been followed successfully on a clean machine or clean clone. |
| Phase 3 | Each active code surface has one owner doc and no unowned module/plugin/store/env remains. |
| Phase 4 | Deployment and release instructions are executable without oral handoff. |
| Phase 5 | Removal candidates are either deleted safely or explicitly retained with written rationale. |

## 6. Standardized Coding Specification Constraints

These constraints must be applied by every developer and AI agent when implementing the documentation system and any supporting code changes.

### 6.1 Naming Rules

- Markdown filenames under `docs/` must use lowercase kebab-case.
- Vue components must remain PascalCase and stay in feature-scoped folders under `app/components/`.
- Composables must use `useXxx.ts` naming and expose a single clear responsibility.
- Pinia stores must keep short lowercase store ids and single-feature ownership.
- Route handlers under `server/api/` must follow Nuxt HTTP suffix naming such as `.get.ts`, `.post.ts`, `.put.ts`, `.patch.ts`, `.delete.ts`.
- Shared route constants must remain centralized in `shared/utils/routes.ts`; duplicate path literals are prohibited when a reusable route constant already exists.

### 6.2 Function And Variable Naming Rules

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use descriptive domain names over abbreviations unless the abbreviation is a project standard such as `API`.
- Prefix boolean variables with readable state semantics such as `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should`.
- Names must reflect runtime boundary when necessary, for example `serverApi`, `publicConfig`, `authStore`.

### 6.3 Mandatory Comment Policy

- Core modules must begin with a short header comment when the file coordinates a cross-cutting concern.
- Header comments are mandatory for:
  - `shared/utils/routes.ts`
  - any new server proxy helper
  - any plugin that injects global behavior
  - any store handling persisted state or hydration-sensitive logic
- Inline comments are required only for:
  - SSR vs client-only guards
  - multi-step auth/cart merge logic
  - non-obvious runtime config usage
  - temporary compatibility workarounds
- Comment rules:
  - explain why, not obvious syntax
  - keep comments current with behavior
  - remove obsolete comments in the same change set that changes behavior

### 6.4 Third-Party Dependency Approval Workflow

- No new dependency may be introduced without explicit approval in code review.
- Every dependency proposal must document:
  - business reason
  - existing alternative considered
  - bundle/runtime impact
  - SSR compatibility
  - security and maintenance posture
- Approved dependency additions must update:
  - `package.json`
  - `docs/configuration/modules.md` or `docs/development/styling-and-ui.md` as relevant
  - `README.md` if the setup flow changes
- Any dependency that injects global runtime behavior also requires `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` rule updates.

## 7. Verification, Review, And Acceptance Criteria

### 7.1 Staged Code Review Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Trigger | Reviewer focus | Acceptance gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| CR-1 Foundation | After Phase 1 | accuracy of scripts, env list, and governance rules | No setup instruction conflicts with `package.json` or `nuxt.config.ts` |
| CR-2 Structure | After Phase 2 | onboarding clarity and directory ownership | New contributor can identify where to add page, component, route, composable, and store code |
| CR-3 Architecture | After Phase 3 | runtime accuracy, SSR/client boundaries, auth/state correctness | No undocumented active module, plugin, store, or env remains |
| CR-4 Engineering | After Phase 4 | coding rules, server route guidance, deployment runbooks | Reviewers can execute documented verification steps successfully |
| CR-5 Closure | After Phase 5 | audit decisions and removal safety | Each removed file has evidence, backup, and dependency validation record |

### 7.2 Targeted Functional Verification Cases

| Module or file group | Required verification case |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Follow quick start on a clean clone and reach `npm run dev` successfully. |
| `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Review a sample code change and verify that required doc-update rules identify all impacted docs. |
| `.env.example` and env docs | Compare all runtime config and `process.env` usages to ensure every active variable is present exactly once. |
| `getting-started/*` | Fresh developer can install dependencies, create local env, and explain repo structure without oral guidance. |
| `architecture/rendering-strategy.md` | Verify SSR/client-only behavior matches `.client.ts` plugins and browser-only logic guards. |
| `architecture/routing-and-navigation.md` | Verify documented routes exist in `app/pages/**` and path constants align with `shared/utils/routes.ts`. |

### 7.3 Cross-Environment Compatibility Checks

The following compatibility checks are mandatory before phase sign-off:

- Local environment:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - page navigation across home, product list, product detail, cart, auth, orders, profile, and search
- Build environment:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run preview`
  - verify no documented step assumes dev-only behavior
- Configuration boundary:
  - verify `NUXT_PUBLIC_*` values are documented as client-visible
  - verify server-only descriptions never instruct direct client usage
- Localization:
  - confirm English and Arabic localization notes align with current `i18n` config and locale files
- SSR safety:
  - confirm docs warn against unguarded `window`, `document`, and local storage usage outside client-only code paths

## 8. Unused File Audit And Formal Removal Workflow

### 8.1 Audit Method

The audit was performed using four checks:

1. repository tree inspection
2. direct string-reference scan across source files
3. Nuxt convention awareness to exclude auto-loaded files from false positives
4. manual review of suspicious files and duplicate declarations

Important rule:

- A file is only classified as `confirmed removable` when it is non-runtime, explicitly unreferenced, or clearly redundant relative to an active replacement.
- Convention-based Nuxt files such as pages, middleware, plugins, stores, and server handlers are not removable solely because they lack explicit import references.

### 8.2 Confirmed Removable Files

| File | Classification | Evidence | Removal priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.dbg/route-double-prefix.env` | Debug artifact | Non-product debug environment file; not part of Nuxt runtime or build flow. | High |
| `.dbg/trae-debug-log-route-double-prefix.ndjson` | Debug artifact | Tool-generated trace log; no application reference. | High |
| `.marscode/deviceInfo.json` | IDE artifact | Editor metadata; not used by app runtime. | High |
| `app/pages/products/.marscode/deviceInfo.json` | IDE artifact | Nested editor metadata file; not part of page routing. | High |
| `project-tree.text` | Snapshot artifact | Static tree dump duplicated by live repository structure; not referenced by the app. | High |
| `search_and_print.sh` | Utility artifact | Manual helper script; not part of package scripts, build, or runtime. | Medium |
| `app/composables/test.ts` | Orphaned experimental helper | Defines `$api` helper but has no consumer; does not match active plugin or composable usage. | High |
| `app/setting.json` | Local editor config artifact | No reference in runtime or build config; not a Nuxt configuration file. | High |
| `app/assets/icons/call.txt` | Orphaned asset artifact | Non-image placeholder file with no source references. | High |
| `app/assets/icons/search.txt` | Orphaned asset artifact | Non-image placeholder file with no source references. | High |
| `app/assets/icons/logo2.png` | Orphaned asset variant | No source references; active logo file is `logo.png`. | Medium |
| `app/assets/icons/logo3.png` | Orphaned asset variant | No source references; active logo file is `logo.png`. | Medium |
| `app/assets/icons/logo4.png` | Orphaned asset variant | No source references; active logo file is `logo.png`. | Medium |
| `app/assets/icons/logo4 (Copy).png` | Duplicate artifact | Duplicate-named variant; no source references. | Medium |
| `app/assets/icons/logo5.png` | Orphaned asset variant | No source references; active logo file is `logo.png`. | Medium |

### 8.3 Review-Required Duplicate Or Redundant Candidates

These files are not approved for immediate deletion, but they require explicit owner review because they look redundant or incomplete.

| File | Audit concern | Required validation before deletion |
|---|---|---|
| `app/types/ofetch.d.ts` | Extends `ofetch` with `showError` and `successMessage`; may supersede the root version. | Verify TypeScript include path and whether root declarations are still needed. |
| `types/ofetch.d.ts` | Partial duplicate of `app/types/ofetch.d.ts`; risk of conflicting declaration ownership. | Consolidate into one canonical declaration file. |
| `types/filters.d.ts` | Empty file containing only `export {}`. | Confirm no tooling relies on its presence, then remove if unnecessary. |
| `types/generated.d.ts` | Mostly commented placeholder content, no obvious live ownership. | Confirm no code generation process targets this file. |

### 8.4 Explicitly Retained Despite Low Direct Reference Count

The following categories must not be removed based only on import scan results:

- `app/pages/**`
- `app/layouts/**`
- `app/middleware/**`
- `app/plugins/**`
- `app/stores/**`
- `server/api/**`
- `server/middleware/**`
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/robots.txt`

Reason:

- Nuxt auto-loads these by convention, or they are runtime web assets expected by browsers and crawlers.

### 8.5 Removal Workflow

1. Create a backup branch named `chore/backup-unused-files-<date>`.
2. Export a backup archive of all `confirmed removable` files to `backup/unused-files-<date>.tar.gz` outside the deploy artifact path.
3. Re-run dependency validation:
   - string-reference scan across source
   - `npm run build`
   - local smoke navigation
4. Delete only `confirmed removable` files.
5. Rebuild and verify:
   - home page
   - auth pages
   - product list and product detail
   - cart and orders pages
   - search flow
6. For each `review-required` candidate:
   - assign owner
   - document keep/remove decision in `docs/reference/decisions.md`
   - delete only after owner approval
7. Record every deletion in `CHANGELOG.md` if it affects contributor workflow or repository structure.

### 8.6 Removal Acceptance Criteria

- No build regression after deletion.
- No TypeScript or runtime error attributable to deleted files.
- No missing asset error in browser console for retained pages.
- No deleted file is later discovered to be auto-loaded by Nuxt or a toolchain step.
- Backup archive is restorable and tested for at least one sampled file.

## 9. Rules That Every Developer And AI Must Follow

- Update documentation in the same change set whenever modifying architecture, env vars, routes, stores, modules, plugins, deployment flow, or external integrations.
- Do not invent undocumented behavior; verify against live code before writing.
- Do not expose secrets, tokens, private keys, or production values in code, docs, screenshots, or `.env.example`.
- Keep `.env.example` and `docs/configuration/environment-variables.md` synchronized.
- Preserve Nuxt terminology exactly: `pages`, `layouts`, `middleware`, `plugins`, `composables`, `server/api`, `runtimeConfig`.
- Document whether behavior runs on client, server, or both.
- Do not add a new store, plugin, module, or route family without updating its owner documentation file.
- Do not create overlapping helpers when an approved shared utility already exists.
- Mark assumptions clearly; do not present guesses as facts.
- Prefer links between owner documents over duplicating long explanations.
- Add an ADR entry for every major architectural or governance decision.

## 10. Phase Success Metrics

| Phase | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Root governance files completed | 5 of 5 foundation files approved |
| Phase 2 | Onboarding completion rate | New contributor reaches running app with zero undocumented blockers |
| Phase 3 | Runtime documentation coverage | 100 percent of active modules, plugins, stores, and env vars documented |
| Phase 4 | Operational readiness | Build and deployment checklists executed successfully end-to-end |
| Phase 5 | Audit closure | 100 percent of confirmed removable files deleted or formally retained with rationale |

## 11. Immediate Execution Recommendation

Start with Phase 1 and create the following files first:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. `.env.example`
4. `README.md`
5. `docs/index.md`

Reason:

- These files establish governance, onboarding, and env ownership, which every downstream doc depends on.
- They also reduce the risk of future documentation drift while the rest of the structure is being built.
